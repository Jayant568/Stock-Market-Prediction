# Stock-Market-Prediction
The Stock Market Prediction Model project designed to forecast future stock price movements based on historical data. This system leverages LSTM neural networks, a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to analyze patterns and dependencies in historical stock price data. 

The system shall evaluate the prediction accuracy using standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). It shall provide comparative analysis with baseline models or benchmark indices.
